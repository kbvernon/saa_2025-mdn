**Session:** "Multi-Scale Data and the History of Human Development in the US
Southwest"

**Title:** "Indirect Dating with Mixture Density Networks"

**Authors:** K. Blake Vernon, Brian F. Codding, Scott Ortman, and Simon C. 
Brewer

**Abstract**

The two most powerful forces driving long-term development in human societies
are climate change and demography, so it should come as no surprise that
so much archaeological research is focused on developing new methods for 
estimating key climate and demographic quantities in the past. To aid in these 
efforts, specifically demographic reconstruction, this project proposes a new 
spatio-temporal deep learning (DL) framework indirect dating. The core of this 
new framework is a Mixture Density Network (MDN) trained on multi-site 
archaeological tree-ring date and ceramic assemblage data. We also show how
to handle mis-aligned data using spatially-weighted feature aggregation and 
spatial basis functions. Training and testing data are provided by cyberSW,
including an extremely large ceramic assemblage dataset covering much of the US 
Southwest.
